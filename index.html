        <h2>1 Introduction</h2>

        <h3>1.0 What is BAM!?</h3>

        <p>BAM! is a serverless framework that makes it quick (hence, the name)
        and easy to get small applications up & running using Node.js and Amazon
        Web Services (AWS). It is optimized for the deployment of AWS Lambda
        functions integrated with AWS API Gateway endpoints, but also allows for
        the creation of DynamoDB tables, which can be used to persist data
        between lambda invocations.</p>

        <p>In comparison to other technologies, the biggest benefits of
        serverless are, arguably, the rapidity of iteration and the abstraction
        of infrastructure management. The irony is that the experience of
        working with serverless technologies often lacks the very simplicity
        that the idea of serverless computing promises to deliver. This led to
        our focus on speed and convenience for the developer as our guiding
        principles.</p>

        <p>This article will examine the design decisions we made while building
        the BAM!  framework, as well as our solutions to a variety of challenges
        we faced.</p>

        <h3>1.1 What is Serverless?</h3>

        <p>The essential idea behind serverless is about where application code
        lives. It is easy to assume that with serverless there are no servers;
        however, this is a false assumption as “serverless” is a misnomer. There
        are physical servers somewhere in the world; they have been abstracted
        away so the developer does not have to manage them. Instead, the code is
        hosted by a third party service, which takes care of all server
        maintenance. For this reason, serverless has become an attractive choice
        for application development.</p>

        <p>There is, however, a tradeoff when using serverless technologies.
        While the developer does not need to worry about managing servers, they
        do give up control over how their code is handled and, to some extent,
        how it is structured. It is important to recognize that serverless,
        although new and popular, is just one option among a variety of server
        management choices, each with their own advantages and
        disadvantages.</p>

          <figcaption>comparison of server management choices</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Looking at the table above, note that the amount of control decreases
        as the level of abstraction increases.</p>

        <p>To start, there are “bare metal” or physical, on-premises servers.
        With this option, the developer has the most control with the least
        amount of abstraction. Next, there is IaaS, “Infrastructure as a
        Service”, where the developer does not have to pay the upfront cost of
        owning and managing physical equipment, but is still required to manage
        the operating system, networking, firewalls, and security of a virtual
        machine. Alternatively, there is CaaS, “Containers as a Service”, with
        which the developer maintains a certain level of flexibility through
        orchestration of encapsulated containers without having to manage the
        operating system.  Depending on the situation, it may make sense to
        abstract away even more server responsibility. In this case, the
        developer could use PaaS, or “Platform as a Service”. With PaaS, the web
        application lifecycle is handled by the platform so the developer only
        has to be concerned with the application code.</p>

        <p>These options offer quite a range of choice, with serverless offering
        the least amount of control, while being easiest to manage. Serverless
        is actually a broad category that encapsulates two others: BaaS (Backend
        as a Service) and FaaS (Functions as a Service).</p>

        <h4>1.1.1 Backend as a Service</h4>

        <p>BaaS involves multiple components pivotal to the operation of the
        back end. There are many different types of BaaS used to accomplish a
        variety of backend tasks, such as storage (e.g. AWS S3) and
        authorization (e.g.  AuthO).</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I want to outsource backend services so I can focus on the
          main functionality of my application.</p>
          <p>- BaaS user</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>1.1.2 Functions as a Service</h4>

        <p>FaaS are small bits of code that live on ephemeral containers usually
        written by the person or organization deploying them. AWS supports FaaS
        with AWS Lambda.<p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I want to write code that accomplishes a small task and can be run
          without worrying about scale or infrastructure.</p>
          <p>- FaaS user</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Being a type of serverless technology, FaaS requires no maintenance,
        which in and of itself is a huge advantage; however, this is not its
        only benefit. Because individual modules of code can be swapped out for
        other modules, iterated upon, and re-deployed, using FaaS allows for
        experimentation and rapid development. Additionally, FaaS is ideal for
        variations in traffic due to its automatic provisioning of
        resources.</p>

        <h4>Why AWS?</h4>

        <p>Developers can enjoy all of the above benefits by using AWS, but
        Amazon is by no means the only provider of serverless technologies.
        There are many others such as Microsoft, Google, and IBM; however, with
        over 1 million active customers, AWS currently enjoys prominence among
        engineers working with the cloud(1). We therefore built BAM! for use
        with AWS.<p>
